# IoT Virtual Doctor Robot

This is a conceptual IoT-based healthcare project designed to simulate a virtual doctor that can monitor basic patient health parameters and send the data remotely to medical staff. It is aimed at minimizing human contact during health emergencies like pandemics.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

In environments where direct doctor-patient contact is risky (like during COVID-19), there's a growing need for contactless healthcare. Monitoring patients remotely can help ensure safety, efficiency, and real-time decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a smart robot using IoT that:
- Monitors basic health data (e.g., temperature)
- Moves toward patients automatically
- Sends data wirelessly to a central system
- Simulates interaction with healthcare professionals

## ðŸ”§ Components Used

- **Arduino UNO** â€“ Central controller
- **Temperature Sensor (DHT11)** â€“ To detect patient body temperature
- **Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/NodeMCU)** â€“ To transmit data wirelessly
- **Motor Driver (L298N)** + wheels â€“ For robot mobility
- **Buzzer/Speaker Module** â€“ For alerts or instructions
- **LCD Display** â€“ To show patient vitals
